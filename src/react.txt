 react   component base application
 -----------------------------------------

 components :create a js file having a name starts with capital letter

 two types of components
 -----------------------------
 1-class based component---statefull component
 2-function based component----stateless component


state is used to store values (also state has an advantage to tranfer value) we can share state to child component

react hook - hook is predefined function and name start with use keyword 


                 syntax :-
                           use predefined-function()



use state() - it is a function used create a state - state using for store value

                 
                 syntax :-
                         
                          
                          const[statename,statevalueupdationdunction]=useState()



props - is used to share data between parent & child
conditional rendering - 


navigation
-----------

1. install react router dom
2. BrowserRouter - use this to starting point to render

features of axios
-------------------

Make http requests from node.js
Supports the Promise API
Intercept request and response
Transform request and response data
Cancel requests
Automatic transforms for JSON data
ðŸ†• Automatic data object serialization to multipart/form-data and x-www-form-urlencoded body encodings

common request config
--------------------------

These are the available config options for making requests. Only the url is required. Requests will default to GET if method is not specified.


  // `url` is the server URL that will be used for the request
  url: '/user',

  // `method` is the request method to be used when making the request
  method: 'get', // default

  // `baseURL` will be prepended to `url` unless `url` is absolute.
  // It can be convenient to set `baseURL` for an instance of axios to pass relative URLs
  // to methods of that instance.
  baseURL: 'https://some-domain.com/api/',

   // `headers` are custom headers to be sent
  headers: {'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest'},

// `data` is the data to be sent as the request body
  // Only applicable for request methods 'PUT', 'POST', 'DELETE , and 'PATCH'
  // When no `transformRequest` is set, must be of one of the following types:
  // - string, plain object, ArrayBuffer, ArrayBufferView, URLSearchParams
  // - Browser only: FormData, File, Blob
  // - Node only: Stream, Buffer, FormData (form-data package)
  data: {
    firstName: 'Fred'
  }

state:state is used to store values(also state has an advantage to tranfer values ) we can share state to child to parent

  1.create a watch history in home page 
  2.create a new component for wartch history 
  3.(id, cardname, link, date)create watch history in db.json value array 
  4.get watch history from json file to watch history component
